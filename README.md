## üåü **Key Features**

### 1. **Environmental Monitoring**  
- Measures **temperature**, **humidity**, **noise levels**, and **light intensity** in real-time.  
- Optimizes energy usage for lighting, heating, or cooling systems.  

### 2. **Proximity Warning System**  
- Multi-sensor safety alerts:  
  - **IR Distance Sensor** detects proximity to the road.  
  - **Force Sensors** and **Proximity Sensors** validate edge safety.  
- **Buzzer Alarm** triggers warnings if users step too close to the road.  

### 3. **Energy-Efficient Lighting**  
- Adaptive lighting system adjusts brightness based on:  
  - Human presence detection.  
  - Lux levels measured at the bus stop.  

### 4. **Bus Arrival Detection**  
- **Google Cloud Vision API** detects bus numbers from images captured by the camera.  
- **Text-to-Speech API** announces bus arrival, e.g., *"Bus 12 has arrived."*  

### 5. **Emergency Alert System**  
- **Button Alarm Click**: Emergency button sends immediate alerts to the server and dashboard.  
- **Analog Buttons** allow users to report issues or emergencies.  

### 6. **Admin Dashboard & Web Features**  
- Displays real-time environmental and safety data.  
- Logs user interactions and emergency alerts.  
- Provides real bus arrival timings through **LTA DataMall API**.

## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Install Node.js and Python**  
Ensure Node.js and Python are installed:  
- Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- Install Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).  

### 2. **Install Required npm Packages**  
In the project directory, run:  
```bash
npm install express socket.io @google-cloud/vision fs path
```

### 3. **Set Up Google Cloud Vision API**  
1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:  
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
2. **Enable the Vision API**.  
3. **Create a Service Account**:  
   - Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.  
   - Generate and download the JSON key file.  
4. **Replace Credentials**:  
   - Update `server.js` with the JSON file credentials (private_key, client_email).  

### 4. **Run the Servers**  

#### Start the Node.js Server  
Run:  
```bash
node server.js
```

#### Start the Python Web Server  
Run:  
```bash
python WebServer.py
```

### 5. **Access the Dashboard**  
- Open your browser and visit:  
  ```http://your device's IP address:5000```

## üì∑ **Bus Arrival Detection Flow**

1. **Image Capture**:  
   - The camera takes a picture of the arriving bus.  
   - The image is converted to **base64** and sent to the backend server via **Socket.io**.  

2. **Google Vision API Processing**:  
   - The image is sent to Google Cloud Vision API for text recognition.  
   - Extracted bus numbers are filtered to match valid bus numbers at the stop.  

3. **Text-to-Speech Announcement**:  
   - If a bus number is detected, the system announces:  
     > *"Bus XX has arrived."*  

4. **Logs and Alerts**:  
   - Data is saved to the database, including timestamps and bus arrival details.
